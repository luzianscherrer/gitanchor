# GitAnchor

This is my contribution to the [ETHOnline Hackathon](https://online.ethglobal.com) taking place from September 2nd to 28th, 2022. 

**More documentation is coming soon...**

For the time being I'm eating my own dog food. The first version of the contract is deployed on the GÃ¶rli Testnet at [0xC3524D9C7bb54929fd7049075Bc2fa05Ba96dF95](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xC3524D9C7bb54929fd7049075Bc2fa05Ba96dF95) and this commit will be anchored.
